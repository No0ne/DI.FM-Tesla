# DI.FM-Tesla
This is a small wrapper script which lets you add all DI.FM premium channels to your Teslas native music player via TuneIn.
* Drop your DI.FM Playlist (including premium key) at the top of the PHP File (difm-tunein-wrapper.php).
* Use the Android/iOS TuneIn App to add the custom URL to the PHP file on your webserver to your favorites folder.
* Login into your TuneIn account in the car and open the newly added playlist.
